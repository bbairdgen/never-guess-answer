# Never Guess Answer Quiz

## Description

I created this quiz to practice creating a site from scracth that incorporates Javascript elements with Web APIs. I did this to work on building my skill. Things on this project finally clicked in regards to how Javascript works. I learned how to get items to hide/display using buttons.

## Usage

To start the quiz, click on "Start Quiz." You will then have 75 seconds to answer 5 questions. For every incorrect question, you will lose 10 seconds from the timer. If the timer reaches 0 before you finish the questions, you will be taken to the score input screen. Your final score is the amount of time left on the timer. The timer is displayed in the top right-hand corner.

You can input your initials and save your score. If you want to try again you can click on the "Home" button to return to the start screen and take the quiz again. 

If you want to see a list of the stored scores, click on "View Highscores" in the top left-hand corner.
